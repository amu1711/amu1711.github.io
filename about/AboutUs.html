                    <p class="info">I am an experienced, passionate and extremely tech-savy real eatate agent with a true passion for Southern Ontario's real estate market.
                        I apply new and different ways to market my client's homes: A sign on the lawn and an ad in your local paper doesn’t work these days. Potential buyers are using sources on the Internet to find their next home.
