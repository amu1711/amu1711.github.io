                                    There are variety of reasons why people sell their homes, but every seller has one thing in common: the desire to get as much money as possible from their existing residence as quickly and as hassle-free as possible. (If you are selling your your principal residence, you won't have to pay tax on any profits from the sale. If, on the other hand, it is an investment property, gain is taxable)<span class="dots">...</span>
