                                        <h4>Are you ready to buy a home?</h4>
                                        <p>The more prepared you are as you start looking for a home, the easier and more enjoyable the process will be. We’ve got you covered every step of the way, from mortgage brokers, inspectors to finding a lawyer.
                                            But keep in mind that there is nothing more frustrating than falling in love with a home only to discover that it is more expensive than you can afford. We can arrange pre-approved mortgage for you. Having a pre-approved mortgage will give you the confidence of knowing exactly what you can spend on your home before you even start looking. Another bonus is the fact that you will also be protected against interest rate increases while you look for your new home. To avoid disappointment (and a lot of wasted time and effort) make sure that your finances are in place as soon as possible. A pre-approved mortgage can be easily obtained and saves you time and energy when placing an offer. With a pre-approved mortgage, you can shop with freedom, confidence and security because you know the money will be there to purchase the home you choose.
                                            But again, no two people are same and no two situations are same either.

                                        <h4>Your one time life Investment</h4>
                                        <p>When buying a home, don't forget the closing cost when buying a home. Some of these costs may include land transfer taxes, title insurance, property valuation fees, home inspection fees, and legal fees. Closing costs, ranging from 1.5 to 4%1 of selling price, are the legal and administrative costs you will need to pay when your house closes. In addition to closing costs, there are other expenses and/or events that may require a cash outlay before, on or after your house closes. We will outline these in detail to ensure these often unexpected costs do not sneak up on you.
                                            Other costs to consider
                                            Property Insurance. Property insurance, which covers the cost of replacing your home and its contents, must be in place on closing day. This insurance is often paid in monthly or annual premiums.
                                            Prepaid Utility Bills. You may need to reimburse the previous owner of your property for prepaid costs such as property taxes, utilities and so forth.
                                            Property taxes. Property tax is calculated as a percentage of your home value, varies by municipality and must be paid each year.
                                            Closing Day
                                            Closing Day is the day you finally take legal possession of your home. It's important the the bulk of your administration is completed by this point including transferring your down payment to your lawyer. Transferring down payment funds, especially from your RRSP can take time, and should be done several days before close.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>Best Mortgage Rates</h3>
                                        <h4>From our development to yours</h4>
                                        <p>A huge majority of potential home buyers would not afford to buy their home on cash purchase. They will be able to pay a small portion of the house price upfront, known as down payment. For the rest of the home price, they will have to seek some kind of loan or financing. This typically means going to a bank or mortgage broker to apply for a mortgage. There are a vast number of options available to potential buyer for mortgage financing. Some of the more common options are discussed below.
                                            Fortunately for buyers, there are a variety of mortgages available. I would strongly recommend any potential buyer investigate each of them to determine which is the best for his/her situation, preferences and golas.</p> Here are some common types of Mortgages.<ul>
                                            <li>Fixed-Rate Mortgages</li>
                                            <li>Adjustable Rate Mortgages</li>
                                            <li>The Convertible ARM</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h4>Fixed Rate Mortgages</h4>
                                        <p>With fixed rate mortgages, a buyer can be certain of his/her mortgages for the term he/she is getting the loan for. Also making extra payments to principal will allow you to pay your loan off sooner. Also fixed rate moertgage is a good if interest are low at the time of mortgage. Buyer will be guanteed the fixed low rate for the whole term of loan.</p>
                                        <h4>Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs)</h4>
                                        <p>If the buyer is more comfortable in taking a risk with his/her money or if interest rates are very high at the time of getting the loan, an Adjustable rate mortgage may be the answer. Buyer might also choose this type of loan if he/she planes to own the property for a short-term or if buyer financial condition is strong enough to cover any potential rise in the interest rate.

                                            Generally, the interest rate when you take out your loan will be lower than a fixed-rate mortgage. But please note that this is true initially, not necessarily long-term.

                                            Since an Adjustable rate mortgages rate rises and falls depending on the prevailing interest rate, monthly mortgage payment will rise and fall accordingly. If buyer(s) income is/are not sufficient to cover the highest possible payments, then this option might not be the solution.

                                            Typically, Adjustable rate mortgages interest rates are tied to a the Federal prime lending rate an the payment will be based on the rate lender uses plus a margin, generally upto two to three points. Veryimportant: these are all general perceptions not the fixed principals. Potential buyer should consult his/her mortgage broker or lender to get all the details and make sure he/she understands these details.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Convertible ARMs</h4>
                                        <p>If neither the fixed-rate or the adjustable rate mortgage seems like the best option, perhaps the convertible ARM might be a good choice for any potential buyer. It is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that the borrower may convert to a fixed-interest rate during a predetermined time period, at an interest rate calculated according to a formula set out in the note. Convertible ARMS can be used to lock in to an interest rate if the borrower feels the rates will increase.
                                        </p>

        <dt><a href="">Types Of Home Ownership</a></dt>
        <dd>Just like there are many different types of homes, there are also many different types of ownership of a residential property distributed across a wide spectrum from the conventional, full Freehold, to a variety of collaborative and long lease options.<ul>
                <li>Freehold</li>
                <li>This type of ownership gives the holder ownership of land and buildings for an indefinite period of time and ffers the most freedom of choice, from building design to yard work, providing it is within zoning, bylaw and permit limitations of the city to which you live.</li>
                <li>Strata Title</li>
                <li>Strata title is a form of ownership devised for multi-level apartment blocks and horizontal subdivisions with shared areas. The owner does have title and thus ownership control over a particular housing strata lot unit such as an apartment or townhouse.</li>
                <li>Cooperative</li>
                <li>Ownership of a cooperative unit is generally considered and interest in personal property because the Cooperative Corporation has ownership of the entire property</li>
                <li>Leasehold Ownership</li>
                <li>In this type of ownership, buyer would own the actual building or unit, but would rent or lease the land itself for a set period of time and there are are varying lease terms.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="">Buying Versus Renting</a></dt>
        <dd>Buy vs Rent: Home ownership almost always has financial benefit over renting in the long run, especially when you decide to live in a permanent location. The biggest advantage of home ownership is your mortgage payments are an investment. You can expect the equity in your home to increase over time as your mortgage is paid down. In contrast, you will lose the money you pay for the rent forever, and the rent can be increased every year.

            In some situations, renting can be beneficial. There are cases where owning is not always the best option. One of the main reason of owning a home is to settle in one area, but because of work or for some other reasons you are not ready to settle, then owning a home can be a burden to you. Owning a home is a long-term commitment. Once you own a home, you have to pay monthly mortgage, different expenses as well as maintenance cost for your home. At the same time, if you don't buy a home, you can have other options like renting a house or an apartment, or even share with your family. Also, you can change the location easier if you don't own a home.
