                                </span></h5>
                            <h5>The Pros</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A good investment condo will break even (or be cash positive) with a 20% down payment (which you require for a mortgage anyway).</li>
                                <li>Opportunity for both cash flow and appreciation in value over time</li>
                                <li>Generally less maintenance/repair work than being the landlord of a house</li>
                                <li>Unique condos in good locations have historically appreciated more than the stock market</li>

                            <h5>The Pros</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Having a basement apartment that you can rent out just might make the difference between affording the home of your dreams and not. At current interest rates, $1,000 in rent can cover over $200,000 in mortgage!</li>
                                <li>Historically, houses have appreciated faster than condos, so if you’re looking to make money when you sell, then an income property may be a safer bet.
                                    With a 20% down payment on a multi-residential house, you should be able to break even (or ideally be cash positive)</li>

                            <h4>FLIPPING INVESTMENT</h4>
                            <h5><span>While it isn’t as popular as it was a few years ago, flipping houses (in other words, buying a rundown house and renovating it for profit in under a year) happens every day in Toronto. It isn’t for the faint of heart – but it can hugely profitable.</span></h5>

                            <h4>The Pros</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A proper quality flip in a good neighbourhood will be in high demand (many of today’s buyers want the fully done-up house)</li>
                                <li>Cash! There are certainly lots of examples of houses bought for $600,000, renovated for $150,000 and sold for $1,000,000</li>

                                    <li>Renovations always take longer and cost more than you expected. With a flip, every dollar spent and every month where you have to pay a mortgage counts.</li>

                            <h4>Financing</h4>
                            <p>Getting a mortgage for a second property isn’t as easy as borrowing for your primary residence and Canadian Govt is making it harder bt the day. You will need at least 20% of the purchase price for a down payment, and only a portion of the income you gets from rent will be considered in qualifying you for a mortgage (usuallybetween 50% - 80%). For commercial properties, you will most likely need a down payment of 50%.</p>
                            <h4>Taxation</h4>

                                <p>In Canada, any money collected from rent is considered income, and thus subject to regular taxation. Increases in the value of your investment property (from the time it becomes an investment property to the time you sell it) will be subject to capital gains taxes. If you’re thinking of buying an investment property, make sure to talk to your accountant to fully understand the tax implications.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Timing</h4>
                                <p>Most real estate investments should have longer-term objectives. Because of the unpredictability of the real estate market, expecting to profit in a short period of time is risky.

                                <h5>Investment Goals</h5>
                                <h4>Cash flow (cash return) </h4>
                                <p>Cash flow is the difference between what you collect in rent and the expenses you pay out. As of writing (2016), cash flow positive properties in Toronto (purchased with 20% downpayment) are hard to come by though it’s fairly common for investors to break-even on a monthly basis (meaning that the rent they collect is equal to the expenses they pay). Cash flow is affected by factors outside of the real estate market, for example, it depends on your downpayment and mortgage terms.</p>
                                <h4>Appreciation</h4>
                                <button type="button" class="btn-sucess" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#cons7">Learn More</button>
                                <div id="cons7" class="collapse">
                                    <p>When you a sell your investment property for more than you paid, that’s called appreciation. For example: you buy a triplex for $700,000 and later sell it for $900,000, that $200,000 difference is the appreciation in the value of your investment. Toronto properties have historically appreciated favourably for investors.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Equity (mortgage paydown)</h4>
                                    <p> When a tenant pays down your mortgage, you’re building equity. For example: you buy a property for $400,000 with an $80,000 downpayment and you apply the rent to the mortgage and rent it for 25 years. Eventually, you will have a mortgage-free property. When you then sell that property for $450,000, you’ll have built up $370,000 in equity (and you’ll get your original investment of $80,000 back).
                                    </p>
